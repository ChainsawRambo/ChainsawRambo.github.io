          <b>Gameplay:</b> The best aspect of this game is the gameplay.  Whether you played any previous Mortal Kombat iterations or not, this game will entice
          any fighting game enthusiast.  Not to mention, the learning curve in this game is almost non-existent so beginners will also be able to
          enjoy this game.  Personally, I have played Mortal Kombat (2011) and Mortal Kombat X and I have to say that Mortal Kombat 11 has improved
          drastically in the gameplay department.  Objectives in fighting games are simple: defeat your opponent.  In Mortal Kombat 11, not only 
          can you defeat your opponent, but you can finish them off as well in a variety of unique ways.  These include Fatalities that occur
          at the end of the battle that requires the player to enter a specific combination of button inputs to begin a sequence where your
          character proceeds to murder your opponent.  Brutalities are essentially different versions of combos or moves that are performed
          as the last one performed before victory after meeting certain requirements like press down, down, down as you do a grab.  
          Varying between the ways you can finish an opponent never gets old!  New to the series are varied character intro and outros which is also
          refreshing.  Another new feature is the re-work of the enhanced special move bar.  In Mortal Kombat X, your X-Ray attack cost three bars
          of a meter that had to be shared to enhance special moves as well.  In Mortal Kombat 11, they have changed the X-Ray attack to the Fatal
          Blow that doesn't cost any bars of your meter and can only be performed when you are below a certain health threshold.  This
          mechanic is great for making a comeback in a losing round or match.  The enahnced special move bar has also been changed to include
          two bars for both offensive and defensive options.  If you want to enhance a combo, it uses the offensive bar.  If you want to escape
          a punishing combo, you can do so at the expense of your defensive bar.  This allows for a better experience in a fighting game that allow
          players of all skill base to do well in it and subsequently enjoy the game more now that they can do those high damage combos and win. <br><br>
          
          In terms of combos and execution of them, it is fairly easy compared to other fighting games like Marvel vs Capcom.  There is no combo
          string that I couldn't perform without much trouble.  However, if you want to do complex combos that string together multiple combos
          and move cancels, you will have to look those up for their timing and specific execution.  Once you do, it shouldn't be impossible to pull
          them off.  Mortal Kombat 11 has also included a new Krushing Blow system that enhances a certain move or combo string to show an attack
          similar to an X-Ray from Mortal Kombat X and allows players to do more damage and sometimes even perform more combos afterward.  Similar to
          Brutalities, Krushing Blows can only be initiated after completing a certain set of requirements beforehand.  The environment can 
          also be used to your advantage like using a weapon that is lying around or a platform to jump across the screen with.
          Overall, all of these new changesto gameplay mechanics are an overwhelming positive addition to the franchise and a worth a lot of praise. <br><br>
          
          However, like all fighting games, the character roster also suffers from character balancing.  Some characters are so much better than others
          that it renders some other characters as unplayable due to an improper balancing.  Fortunately, not many characters are too overpowered that
          no character other than them can defeat them.  As long as you learn your character, how they play, how fast they are at blocking, attacking,
          recovering, and their moves, you should be fine.  Just stay away from Liu Kang players!  Otherwise, the gameplay is solid in this
          installment in the franchise. <br><br>
