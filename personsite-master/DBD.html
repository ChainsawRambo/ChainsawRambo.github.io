          <u>Description:</u> Dead by Daylight is an asymmetrical, multiplayer (4vs1) horror game where one player takes on the role of a savage killer, and the other four players become Survivors frantically scurrying to avoid being caught, tortured and killed.
Survivors play in third-person and have the advantage of better situational awareness. The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey.
The Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play.
FEATURES:
Survive Together… Or Not – Survivors can either cooperate with the others, or be selfish. Chances for survival depend on your decisions.
Where Am I? – Each level is procedurally generated, so you'll never know what to expect. Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world, and its dangers, change every time you play.
A Feast for Killers – Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. Play anything from a powerful Slasher to a terrifying paranormal entity. Familiarize yourself with your Killing Grounds and master each Killer's unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims.
Deeper and Deeper – Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer.
Real People, Real Fear – You'll never know how things will turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time, you might even discover what's hiding in the fog.

          <b>Gameplay:</b> I have been playing this game since it was released on PC back in 2016 and I still haven't had any trouble
          finding a reason to come back to this game.  As a killer, your objective is simple: hook survivors to progress their death, prevent
          survivors from completing generators and stop them from escaping through the exit gate or hatch.  Each killer is given a unique power that they can use to gain an advantage over survivors whether it be traps, teleportation, or even a running chainsaw!  However, the choice of killer,
          perks, add-ons, offerings and strategy determine how well you are rewarded for your efforts.  No matter if you play as the killer or survivor,
          you will always earn Bloodpoints which is the equivalent of experience points that you can use to level up and get more perks, add-ons,
          offerings and obtain the option to Prestige to get exclusive bloody cosmetics and better odds at better aforementioned items.  
          As the killer, bloodpoints are awarded based on an emblem system of Deviousness, Sacrifice, Brutality, and Hunting.
          Deviousness is essenitally a category multiplier for using your killer's power and having uncompleted generators at the end of the game.
          Sacrifice is a category multiplier dedicated to hooking, killing and bleeding-out survivors with extra points thrown in if survivors disconnect.
          Brutality is a category multiplier for hitting survivors, hooking them, regressing generators and destroying paletts.
          Hunting is a category multiplier for chasing survivors and subsequently hitting them to down them.
          If you fail to do these things well or decide to camp hooked survivors, you will not get a lot of points in these categories and will not get a lot
          bloodpoints as a result of this. Categories also have tiers of no emblem, bronze, silver, gold, and iridescent to reflect this.<br><br>
          
          As a survivor, your objective is to complete generators and escape.  Typcially, you have to complete 5 generators to unlock the exit gate
          to open an escape if more than one survivor is alive.  However, certain add-ons and amount of survivors can change this.  If at least one generator
          is completed and only one survivor remains, the hatch appears and the survivor can use this as an alternative escape if the killer doesn't close
          it first!  Survivors have the option of working together with others or going alone solo, but I suggest working together with others
          for the best odds at survival.  You are going to need help if you are hooked or injured!  During the game, survivors can also search chests
          to obatin add-ons like flashlights, med-kits, keys, maps and other event items that will aid in their survival.  Nothing like a flashlight
          to blind a killer and allow other players to escape their grasp and save them from being hooked!  To combat the killer, survivors are only
          allowed to use flashlights to blind a killer, paletts to throw down on killers to stun them, and windows to vault over to out-manuever
          killers.  This is a game of stealth and at times a skillful game of running away, throwing down paletts, and juking.  Hiding from the killer
          is the best option compared to confrontation where you are given the option to hide in lockers, but if you are found, the killer can instantly
          grab you from it and take you to the nearest hook!  Emblems for survivors include Objectives, Survival, Altruism and Boldness.  Objectives is a
          category multiplier for repairing/completing generators and opening exit gates.  Survival is a category multiplier based on how quickly you escape, if you escape.
          Altruism is a category multiplier for healing other survivors, taking hits for other survivors, unhooking survivors and other tasks
          that include helping others.  Boldness is a category multiplier for getting chased by the killer while trying no to get hit where you gain
          additional points for the duration of the chase, if you stun the killer with paletts during one, and if you lose the killer. <br><br>

        <p>
          <b>Single-Player/Campaign/Story:</b> The only single-player in this game is in the form of killer and survivor tutorials.  They teach
          the basics for both killers and survivors if you are new to the game.  Definitely play these before jumping into online matches
          to avoid scrutiny from others and improve your chances of survival.  In terms of story, the game's lore is displayed in the form of 
          bios of survivors and killers.  Recently, the developers released limited-time events called Rifts and Tomes to obtain audio logs and 
          animated cinematics to expand upon this lore.  It is definitely worth reading these bios and obtaining these Tomes as their contents are
          quite intriguing and different from other games.  Just don't expect AAA quality cinematics and voice-acting because there is none.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Multiplayer:</b> The entire game is primarily multiplayer and can be done in private matches or public matches that are split into solo
          matches as either a killer or survivor or Survive with Friends, which allows you to search with friends.  It should be noted that this game
          does NOT support in-game chat so I suggest you use your console's respective party chat system as it helps greatly.  Survivors connect to the killer's game where
          the killer is the host so if he/she leaves the game, it ends.  Not the best for a multiplayer game, but host migration would probably not work
          with the way this game plays.  The best way to play is with friends as is with most multiplayer games.  
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Visuals/Setting:</b> The graphics for this game are good, but not great if you are playing on consoles.  Otherwise, they are much better on PC.
          My only complaint with the graphics are the lack in detail of some minor things of the environment, but no complaints are made about character models.
          In terms of the setting, the maps are great because they vary in location and in aesthetic.  The majority of maps feel unqiue and different from
          others with some exceptions to the original maps at launch that have different variations, but even then they are different enough to change
          the way you play on them.  Maps are free to all players regardless of whether or not they have any DLC which is definitely a positive in today's
          day and age.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>DLC:</b> The amount of DLC might seem staggering, but that is a good thing.  It has been almost 4 years since this game has come out
          and the developers are still supporting this game with free maps and paid DLC survivors and killers.  This paid DLC includes all new original
          survivors and killers as well as licensed guest characters like Micheal Myers and Laurie Strode from Halloween, Freddy Krueger and Quentin Smith
          from A Nightmare on Elm Street (Reboot), Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Amanda Young (The Pig) and Detective David Tapp,
          Bill from Left 4 Dead, Ghostface from Scream, Ash Williams from Ash vs. Evil Dead, The Demogorgon and Nancy Wheeler and Steve Harrington
          from Stranger Things.  All of which are great additions to the game and are all welcome by me.  In addition to maps and characters, the game
          offers players the option to customize their characters with paid cosmetic DLC like outfits and outfit items.  The outfits and their respective
          items are pretty expensive if you ask me, but are by no means necessary.  Alternatively, you can also earn characters for free using iridescent
          shards gained by leveling up a player's account as well as earning bloodpoints.  Having the option to get DLC for free or earning it
          is great in my opinion to not lock the player base who can't afford to pay for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Music:</b> The music in this game is pretty basic and repetitive, but accomplishes its goal of keeping survivors on their toes.
          Some killers even have their own sounds and music which is pretty cool especially for Micheal Myers and Freddy Krueger.  There is nothing
          more intense or terrifying than hearing music similar to John Carpenter's iconic Halloween theme or Freddy Krueger's one-two-Freddy's Coming For You theme!
          Otherwise, the music just serves as an audio cue of how close the killer is to you and if you should panic or not.  In other words, limited and repetitive, but
          serves its purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Other Noteworthy Features:</b> The only thing I can mention is the level of commitment and dedication that the developers put into this game.
          This game is constantly being balanced, re-worked, and supported with numerous DLCs to keep the player base coming back for more!
          An accolade that few tend to achieve for a game that has been out this long.
